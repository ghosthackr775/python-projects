#create a file named Shoes.py and pase in the following code:

class Shoes:
	def __init__(self, name, price):
		self.name = name
		self.price = float(price)
	def budget_check(self, budget):
		if not isinstance(budget, (int, float)):
			print('Invalid entry. Please enter a number.')
			exit()
			
	def change(self, budget):
		return (budget - self.price)
		
	def buy(self, budget): 
		self.budget_check(budget)
		
		if budget >= self.price:
			print(f'You can copy some {self.name}')
			
			if budget <= self.price:
				print('You have exactly enough money for these shoes.')
			else: 
				print(f'You can buy these shoes and have ${self.change(budget)} left over.')
				
				exit('Thanks for using our shoe budget app!')

#now create a file shoepurchase.py and paste in the following code:

#!/bin/python3

from Shoes import Shoes

low = Shoes('And 1s', 30)
medium = Shoes('Air Force 1s', 120)
high = Shoes('Off Whites', 400)

try:
	shoe_budget = float(input('What is your shoe budget? '))
except ValueError:
	exit('Please enter a number.')

for shoes in [high, medium, low]:
	shoes.buy(shoe_budget)

#then run python3 shoebudget.py to see if you can cop some sneaks!
